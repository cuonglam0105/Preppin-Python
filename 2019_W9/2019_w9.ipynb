We need to know the common themes of these tweets and be ready to re-run this analysis at any time. In order to do that, we want you to make the data available to build a view on what common words are used in the complaint tweets.\n",

    "* Output a list of words used alongside the original tweet so we know the context for how the word was used. \n",
