    "# 2024: Week 32 - Pokémon Card Organising\n",
    "\n",
    "August 07, 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge by: Jenny Martin\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently got back into Pokémon card collecting, which not only involves collecting new sets, but also going through old sets I had as a child and organising those. For this challenge we'll be focusing on 2 really cool old sets: Gym Heroes and Gym Challenge. They contain cards of Pokémon that belong to particular gym leaders in the Kanto region, such as Blaine's Vulpix, one of my personal favourites:\n",

    "Now, traditionally, you would organise cards using the number in the bottom right corner e.g. 65/132 in the above example. But for these sets, I wanted to organise them all:\n",
    "\n",
    "- based on which gym leader they belong to\n",
    "- in the order of the Kanto gyms \n",
    "- with the Gym Leader card first\n",
    "- followed by their Gym card\n",
    "- followed by the remaining Trainer cards associated with them (in card number order)\n",
    "- followed by their Pokémon in Pokédex order\n",
    "- using the Pokémon level in the bottom left corner of the card, where a leader has multiple of the same Pokémon\n",
    "- with leftover trainer cards not associated with a leader at the end (in card number order, with the Gym Heroes set coming before the Gym Challenge - set where there are ties)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see why I turned to Tableau Prep to implement this logic! It got quite confusing trying to do it by hand - particularly when I don't own all the cards for these sets. Yet! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using a couple of inputs this week. Luckily there's a Pokémon Trading Card Game API that we've pulled most of the data from, as well as using Bulbapedia to get information about the Pokédex number.\n",

    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Input the data\n",
    "- For the Pokémon Cards Input, separate the Gym Leader and Pokémon\n",
    "- e.g. Blaine's Vulpix becomes Blaine and Vulpix in separate fields\n",
    "- Use the Pokémon Input to bring in information about the Pokédex Number\n",
    "- Make sure not to duplicate any rows\n",
    "- Combine with the Trainer Cards Input\n",
    "- Use the Table Names field to identify the Card Type, either Pokémon or Trainer\n",
    "- Any rows that do not have a Leader, assign as \"Leftover Trainers\"\n",
    "- Combine with the Leader Order Input\n",
    "- Based on the above description, find a way to sort the cards into the correct order\n",
    "- Remove unnecessary fields\n",
    "- Output the data\n",
