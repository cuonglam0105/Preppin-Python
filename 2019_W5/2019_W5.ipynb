    "I have often wondered whether I would have a career if it wasn't for projects delivering new operational systems not considering that the 'Junk In' to 'Junk Out' rule is a very pertinent one. Project budget cuts, lack of data awareness and time constraints all lead to a perfect storm of project delivery challenges. One of the side-effects of this is felt as soon as the project releases; how is the new system performing and is it doing what we expected? Welcome to this week's challenge!\n",
